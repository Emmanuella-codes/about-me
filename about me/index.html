      <p>Above are a handful of the designs I've created for businesses I've launched in the last four years. 
      Being a Graphic Designer has its advantages in that I don't have to break the bank to get a design that reflects my vision. 
      Above all, I'm a firm believer in getting something cute and sturdy without going overboard, which is why I founded these businesses. 
      I intended to make all of these things available to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. </p>

    <p>I launched the digital art business to combat the stigma associated with owning works of art valued thousands or millions of naira. 
      I developed artwork that addressed mental health issues as well as uplifting words that may make the owners smile.</p>

  <div class="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Chukwu Emmanuella Ijeoma and I'm from Delta State, Nigeria, although I was born in Lagos State and have lived here since then. 
      Lagos is a love/hate relationship for me, yet it is the one location I can call home with certainty. I'm the fifth child in a family of five. 
      I'm a Graphic Designer and Creative Writer who wants to become a Full-Stack Developer so that I can provide answers to my clients and anyone 
      else who needs my help.</p>

      <legend>Below are a few important things i like to do:</legend>
      <ul>
        <li>Praying</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Checking up on my loved ones</li>
        <li>Playing with my dogs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>My favorite quote is from an Indian author and Yogi, known for founding the Isha Foundation, which provides everyone in the world with a platform 
        to explore their spiritual side of life 
        by means of meditation and yoga.</p>
